NYCU Spring 2022 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Finding the Perfect Playlist

## Abstract
Music gives great companionship to most people along with any kind of situation, but most of the time we are not able to successfully identify which emotion we are going through at present. In this project, we classify peopleâ€™s mood by approaches including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and BERT Fine-tuning. Regarding the validation accuracy, we found that the BERT Fine-tuning model has the best learning performance, so we further implemented this model by using the determined result to find the corresponding song.
